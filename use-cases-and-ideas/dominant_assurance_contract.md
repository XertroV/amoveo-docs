Dominant Assurance Contracts
==================

Also called DACs, are tools to raise funds to pay for public goods.
The people who benefit from these public goods are the ones who pay for them.
No one pays more than how much it could benefit them.

Mechanism
==============

We use futarchy mechanisms to measure how much this public good will benefit the stock price of many companies in the case where they don't have to pay for it. Now we have a list of who will benefit, and by how much.

We take the costs of how much it will cost to build the public good.

We verify that the total benefit is more than 150% of the cost of building it, otherwise the DAC will fail.

We use a secure random number to remove about 1/3rd of the companies from the list, weighted by how much they benefit.

We distribute the costs to the companies that will benefit proportionally to how much they will benefit.

If every company agree to pay their portion, then we attempt to build it. If the public good gets built, then the builder gets the money that the companies had provided. If the public good is not built, then every investor gets a refund, plus some extra money from the builder for having wasted their time.

If even one company refuses to pay their portion, then we do not build it.

Why cancel it if someone doesn't agree to pay?
========================

If there was a way to not participate, then every company would prefer to not pay, and be able to benefit from the public good anyway.

Why remove 30% from the list?
========================

The prediction market is asking about the case when they are not on the list. So we need there to be some significant probability that each company will not be included, that way there is enough probability space available to be measured by the prediction market.

Why does the prediction market ask about their benefit conditional on them not having to pay?
===============

We want to measure how much the public good would have benefited each company, independent of the impact this DAC has on them.

The older version of the DAC involved insurance, why did we get rid of that?
================

For the DAC to work, we need to know how much the public good will benefit various entities. One way we had though to get them to reveal this information is by selling insurance.
The problem with selling insurance is that if that insurance potentially comes with an obligation to pay for something that would have been free otherwise, this significantly impacts how much insurance they are willing to buy, and so the price of insurance fails to reveal how much each entity is benefiting from the public good.
