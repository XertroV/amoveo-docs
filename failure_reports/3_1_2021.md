=====

On this date, for a period of about 9 hours, no new blocks were mined. Starting at block 146219.

Loss
======

330 - 219 blocks = 111 blocks
22:14:14 - 00:44:52 = 22 hours 39.5 minutes = 1359.5

11 minutes per block. 1359.5 minutes should be about 123.6 blocks. but only 111 blocks were found.

during the 9 hours, about 50 blocks were skipped.
but because of lower difficulty afterwards, only around 11.6 block rewards were missed.
According to qtrade, the current price is $20.14.
the block reward is about 0.104 veo.
```$20.14 * 0.104 * 11.6 = $24.30.```

About $77.50 of hashpower was wasted because of my mistake, and I sincerely apologize to miners and mining pools who are paying this cost.

What happened
======

At block 146220 hard update #44 activated to turn off support for legacy txs related to the old format of channels, and to get rid of the old Merkle for storing channel data, and to pay refunds to anyone who still had money left in the legacy Merkle tree.

The new strategy is that channels are one type of smart contract, and so they get stored in the smart contract Merkle tree.

This hard update was poorly planned, and it ended up corrupting the database on nodes that attempted to build a block according to the new ruleset, and preventing these nodes from producing more blocks.

To fix this, we canceled hard update 44, and resynced the nodes that had been corrupted.
