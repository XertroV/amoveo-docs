Financial Derivatives
==========

A financial derivative is the most basic financial instrument.
Primary colors are to colors what financial derivatives are to finance.
The same way you can combine the primary colors to produce all possible colors, you can combine financial derivatives to create any financial portfolio.

the chemical elements are to chemistry what financial derivatives are to finance.
The same way you can combine the chemical elements to produce all possible chemicals, you can combine financial derivatives to create any financial portfolio.

If you are a farmer who is growing orange fruit trees, there is a lot of risk for you if the price of orange fruits should drop before you are ready to harvest.
You could use a financial derivative to hedge this risk.
That way you can lock in the current price of oranges, so when your oranges are ready you can sell them at the price you locked in.

Financial derivatives are older than written language.
Financial derivatives are the most popular use-case of currency.

What it comes to software tools, it seems like simple tools that do their job well end up more successful in comparison to tools that try to do too many different things.

I can't see any reason that a platform for financial derivatives could be improved by adding crypto-kitties, or subcurrencies, or DAO-voting-pools, or any of the other crazy finance experiments people have been doing lately.

Financial derivatives are popular today for the same reason they have been popular since prehistory, which is the same reason that they will be popular in the future.
Financial derivatives are a scalable way to hedge risks.
They are scalable because their enforcement doesn't require any shared mutable state.




Computer programmers don't know enough about finance to know what a derivative is.
Finance people don't know enough about programming to realize why the lack of shared state is so important in the success of derivatives.
