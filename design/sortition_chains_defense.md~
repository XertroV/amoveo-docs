Sortition Chain Defense
=============

The purpose of this document is to look at several criticisms of sortition chains, and see if they will break under various attacks.


What if a Sortition Chain Operator Sells All Their Stake, and then Goes Offline?
===========

Looking at the example of 3 generations of sortition chains, where the middle generation has sold all their stake, and then gone off-line.

Now the grandparent generation wants to buy back all the contracts it sold to hedge it's risk before the sortition chain ends, but the middle generation is gone, so it can't update the contracts with them.

The operators of the grandchildren chains can make sortition contracts with the operator of the grandparent chain, selling all of the contract back to the grandparent, without the middle generation even needing to come online.

So the operator of the grandparent sortition chain ends up controlling many many of his great-grandchild sortition chains.

For this to work, sortition chains need to have the option of reporting the merkel root of their sortition-contracts onto any ancestor, not just the direct ancestor. That way you can still update your contract, even if the person you bought it from went off-line.
