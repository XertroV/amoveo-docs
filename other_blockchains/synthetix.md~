Synthetix Review
========

[Synthetix litepaper](https://www.synthetix.io/uploads/synthetix_litepaper.pdf)

Synthetix is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
SNX is the cryptocurrency that powers Synthetix.
The goal of Synthetix is to allow users to trade synthetic assets, all priced in SNX.

"financial derivative" just means a limited kind of smart contract that works like a bet. 2 people lock money in, and on the expiration date the contract will distribute all the money to those 2 people.

"Synthetic assets" means using financial derivatives to create stablecoins.
In the cryptocurency community, we often use the name "stablecoin" when talking about synthetic assets.
For example, you can use a synthetic USD smart contract to make USD stablecoin.

SNX limiting the volume of stablecoins
===========

Synthetix only supports using the subcurrency SNX as collaterol.
Synthetix targets a collaterollization ratio of 7.5x or more collaterol for all the stablecoin contracts created.

this means that the total market cap of stablecoins enabled by synthetix will always be less than about 2/15ths of the market cap of SNX.

They should have just used Eth for this collaterol. There is no reason to have a new subcurrency.
