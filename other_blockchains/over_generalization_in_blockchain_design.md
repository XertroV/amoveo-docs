Over-Generalization in Blockchain Design
=============

There is this general pattern I am noticing in all these scam projects.
They refuse to make decisions that would lead to it being too obviously broken.

Simple Example
=========

There is a Russian who can build blockchains.

There is a Russian who is 6 feet tall.

Therefore: all Russians are 6 feet tall, and can build blockchains.

In Blockchains
=========

The scam project works like this.
Their paper outlines a massive space of possible blockchain designs.
For every possible attack, they show that there is some design inside the massive space which would be secure against that attack.

and then they conclude: "we proved it is secure against all possible attacks!"

How to be secure against this kind of scam
============

Demand that they give a single design which is simultaneously secure against all the attacks.

Common Examples
=========

For example, alternative blockchain designs almost never admit to what the fork choice rule is.
