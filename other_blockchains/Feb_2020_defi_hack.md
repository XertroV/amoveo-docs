Amoveo Defi Security
===========

We at Amoveo have always taken security very seriously. [We created a superior definition of security based on mathematical principles that almost no projects have managed to meet](/basics/trust_theory.md) and used it to arguably build the most robust platform for decentralized finance. 

There have been doubts as to whether such a high level of security is needed however when constructing systems where millions or even billions of dollars are at stake, attackers will stop at nothing to try and exploit system.
Recently several defi systems on Ethereum were hacked https://decrypt.co/19612/how-a-genius-hacker-made-350000-exploiting-defi
Technical details of the attack https://www.palkeo.com/en/projets/ethereum/bzx.html

Alarmingly, this recent hack was of an exploit that had been existing for a long time but had gone unnoticed due to developers not having the paranoia that we at Amoveo have about security. Like a ticking time bomb, devastating security vulnerabilities can lurk in systems that haven't thouroughly conducted the proper research. A lot of the times, security vulnerabilities are completely abstract and extremely complex, in-fact the lead developer of Amoveo has discovered [such exploits in many blockchains using Proof of Stake and other voting mechanisms to operate.](/other_blockchains/proof_of_stake.md)

Attempting to recover from these attacks demonstrates another major weakness of modern decentalized finance. Most projects have centralized governance systems, which can further be considered a vulnerability. If there is a person or team that can make the decision to turn a smart contract off, or update the smart contract, then it is centralized and insecure. [Futarchy](/basics/futarchy.md) is the only known secure protocol for a group of people to make a decision together. All defi projects need futarchy, so that they can adapt to the ever changing environment that we live in, and recover when things go unexpected.

A good DeFi system has two important pieces that need to be secure. It needs a secure oracle system to bring in data to the blockchain about the world. For example, if the blockchain knows the price of USD or gold, then we can make an asset that stays the same value as USD or gold. And a secure trading system to match trades and prevent any front-running, free options, or other trading system exploits.

These 2 pieces are sufficient to allow for futarchy governance.

This is why Amoveo is the leading standard for secure decentralized finance in the industry.
