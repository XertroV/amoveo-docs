Amoveo Defi Security
===========

We at Amoveo have always taken security very seriously. [We created a superior definition security that almost no projects manage to meet](/basics/trust_theory.md)
We care so much about security, it is bordering on paranoia. There has been doubts as to whether such a high level of security is needed.

Recently several defi systems on Ethereum have been hacked https://decrypt.co/19612/how-a-genius-hacker-made-350000-exploiting-defi

Alarmingly, this recent hack was of an exploit that had been existing for a long time. This shows that insecure systems can stay unexploited for a long time, like a ticking time bomb. Maybe other popular systems that don't meet the mathematical definition of secure will also fail. [For example PoS](/other_blockchains/proof_of_stake.md)

Attempting to recover from these attacks demonstrates another major weakness of modern defi. Most projects have centralized governance systems, which are a centralized vulnerability in their project.
If there is a person or team that can make the decision to turn a smart contract off, or update the smart contract, then it is centralized and insecure.
[Futarchy](/basics/futarchy.md) is the only known secure protocol for a group of people to make a decision together. All defi projects need futarchy, so that they can adapt to our changing environment, and recover when things go unexpected.


A good defi system has 2 important pieces that need to be secure.
It needs a secure oracle system to bring in data to the blockchain about the world. For example, if the blockchain knows the price of USD or gold, then we can make an asset that stays the same value as USD or gold.
And a good defi system needs a secure trading system to match trades and prevent any front-running, or free options, or other trading system exploits.

These 2 pieces are sufficient to allow for futarchy governance.
