Idena
==========

https://idena.io/

Idena is a blockchain that tries to achieve consensus through a democratic process where one human = one vote.
They do this by having a weekly short period of time where they give out problems that are hard for computers, and easy for people. AI-hard problems.

Idena is not secure.
===========

Even if Idena did work, and was a secure one-human-one-vote protocol, that is still not secure. [you can't have secure voting in blockchains](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs/blob/master//design/voting_in_blockchains.md)

But, they also fail to build a secure one-human-one-vote protocol.

Idena gives out the same AI-hard problems to all the participants, and the median of their responses is the correct response.
This means if one person controls multiple accounts, they can solve the problem once, and then it is solved in all their different accounts. So, Idena is vulnerable to sybil attacks.
