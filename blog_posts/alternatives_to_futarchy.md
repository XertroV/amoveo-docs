Alternatives to Futarchy
===============

Futarchy is a method by which a group of people can make a decision together.
The goal of this document is to compare futarchy with other methods that people use for making decisions.


Battle of Champions
==============

One way decision have been made historically, each side of the debate would nominate their own champion.
The champions were people who would compete against each other in a game.
The entire community agrees to go with the decision that the winning champion wanted.

The champions might fight each other directly, or compete in a running race, or try to jump over fires they each would build. Many different kinds of games could be used.

Battles of champions have the advantage that they are entertaining. So everyone in the community will pay attention, which means it is easy for us all to agree on the outcome, so they are an effective coordination mechanism.

The disadvantage of this strategy is that we will often coordinate on the worse decision.
Just because one of the decisions is better doesn't mean the champion of that decision will win.

Rhetoric
===========

Another popular way to make decisions is to have a reasoned oral debate.
Each side nominates an orator, and the orators take turns trying to explain why their choice is better for the community.

Rhetorical debates have the advantage that the decision which is better for the community is easier to argue for than the decision which is bad for the community. So there is a tendancy that the better decision is the one that wins.

Rhetorical debates have the disadvantage that it can be unclear who won. And they have the disadvantage that it can be very costly individually to follow along with the debate. The logic and reasoning can become complicated, and it is expensive for the listeners to understand.

As the community trying to make a decision grows bigger, the cost of understanding the costs and benefits becomes more expensive. Rhetorical debates are most effective for very small groups of people making decisions. This strategy does not scale, it becomes less effective as the group gets bigger.

Sortition
============

With sortition, every member of the community has equal probability of being selected. Whoever is selected has complete control over the decision that the community will make.

Sortition has the advantage that whoever is selected, only that one person has to do the work to find out which decision is better. This is far cheaper than having the entire community do this work.

Sortition has the disadvantage that it is hard to be sure that the random selection process wasn't cheated. If we are drawing a name out of a hat, you need to be sure that each person's name is only in the hat once. As the community gets bigger, it eventually becomes cost-prohibitive to securely select one person at random.

Another disadvantage of sortition is that sometimes the random person who was selected, they are biased somehow, and will make a decision that is in their own interest instead of in the community's interest. They could get bribed.

King
===========

Having a dictator or royal make our decisions for the entire community. Giving one individual complete control of the community's decisions.

Letting a king decide has the advantage that it is fast, cheap, and scalable.
If only one person needs to understand the costs and benefits, just educating one person is faster than trying to educate more than one person. So having a king is the very fastest strategy possible.

Only educating one person is cheaper than educating more than one person. So having a king is the very cheapest strategy possible.

No matter how big the community gets, the cost of making decisions doesn't change. So this strategy can scale up for very large communities.

Having a king does have some disadvantages. The king is vulnerable to propaganda and bribery. He tends to make decisions that are best for himself, instead of decisions that are best for the community.

The king is not parallelizable, if he is working to make one decision for us, he can't simultaneously be working to make some different decision. So this strategy does not scale up for large numbers of decisions.

Occasionally it becomes unclear who the king is, and this can cause violence as people compete to establish their claim to the role. During these violent periods we don't have a mechanism to make decisions.


Voting
=================

Voting, also called democracy, is a system where each member of the community writes their prefered choice, and we go with whichever choice is prefered by a larger portion of the community.

Voting has many disadvantages.

With voting we have the rational ignorance problem. As the number of participants increases, the expected costs to become an educated voter increase, because the decision is more complicated. And the expected benefits of being an educated voter decrease, because the probability that your vote will be pivotal decreases.
Once the expected benefits of being an educated voter are lower than the expected costs of being an educated voter, then the rational strategy becomes to vote from a position of ignorance.

As the number of voters increases, it becomes more expensive to be sure that each person only had 1 vote each. This is similar to the problem of being sure that sortition process wasn't cheated.

Mathematically speaking, it is not possible to build a voting protocol that actually measures the preferences of the community. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem

Voting protocols are vulnerable to propaganda. People can be tricked into voting for things that are not in their own interest.

Science
===========

Science means coming up with hypothesis to explain the world around us, and then trying very hard to disprove the hypothesis. If you cannot disprove it, that is evidence that the hypothesis is true. You write up details explanations of the experiments you did to try and disprove your hypothesis. Other people can repeat the experiment for themselves to verify your results.

Science has advantages.

With science we can have very strong evidence that one option is better for the community than the other.
So with science there is a tendency that we make the choice that is better for the community.


Science has disadvantages.

Not all decisions can be formatted as scientific experiments. It is costly to come up with experiments in the first place. There might not be sufficient scientists inventing experiments to be able to use the scientific method in all cases. A rich person can influence science by providing funding only for those experiments which help support the outcome that they prefer.

It can be expensive to repeat the experiment for yourself to verify that it works. Having everyone in the community repeat tons of random experiments all the time is not scalable. The cost is (number of people in the community) * (number of decisions that need to be made).



Futarchy
===========

Futarchy means carefully crafting financial betting markets, and making our decision based on the prices of those markets.

Futarchy has advantages.

Futarchy is intensely scalable. We can make many decisions simultaneously.

Futarchy is very cheap. We don't have to waste any time trying to educate people. People who are already knowlegeable have an incentive to participate, people who are ignorant have an incentive to not participate.

Futarchy is the only decision making protocol that is secure against rich people who want to use their money to influence the outcome. 


Futarchy has disadvantages.

It can take a lot of time for the entire futarchy process to occur. Anywhere from 3 days to 2 months can be needed.

It can be unclear how much futarchy evidence is enough. If the market only has $1 in it, that is not enough of an incentive for knowledgeable people to participate in the market. It isn't clear how much liquidity a market needs to be valid for futarchy.

If the market only lasts for 1 day, that is not enough time for all the knowledgeable people to realize that a profit opportunity exists for them. It isn't clear how much time a market needs to exist for to be valid for futarchy.
