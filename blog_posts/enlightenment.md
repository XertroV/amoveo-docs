The enlightenment is stalling.
Humanity is stuck half way between the age of reason, and the age of faith.

Atheists won the memes, but theists still control the genes.

The ability to use reason and logic is incredibly powerful, and has allowed us to conquer nature in unimaginable ways. These same tools that give us power to know why some decisions are better than others, they also strip us of our ability to cooperate.
Once we can use reason to know that a goal isn't in our best interest, we stop cooperating to achieve that goal.
Without faith to unite us, we become scattered and weak.

Without the ability to cooperate, humanity is on a death march towards extinction.

And so we find ourselves in a world with:
* rich atheist cultures that constantly vanish.
* poor theist cultures that constantly grow, and then get consumed by the memes of reason, to convert into new atheist cultures.

Futarchy is the solution.
With futarchy, reasonable people will finally be able to cooperate the way faith-based people can.

We will finally have rich, stable, long-lasting cultures who are capable of making decisions in their own best interest, and cooperating to achieve shared goals.
