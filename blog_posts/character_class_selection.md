Character Class Selection
===========

I notice a lot of crypto players are struggling with the character class selection process. Some players keep switching back and forth between different classes, wasting valuable XP points on unused branches of the tech tree. Other players end up choosing the wrong character class, because they don't understand the differences between the available classes.

The goal of this document is to describe the differences between the available class types, to help new users decide which class is right for them, and to help experienced users avoid wasting XP.

## Character Classes Available

There are 6 available character classes in cryptocurrency, and they can be organized into a 2 by 3 chart.
You need to decide if your character will focus on past vs present vs future. You need to decide if your character will focus on the "evil" or "good" side of the tech tree.
```
         Past        Present         Future
------------------------------------------------
Good-    Academic    Artist          Philosopher
Evil-    Ritualizers Credential-Lord Utopist
```

## Good/Evil

If you have a good-specialized character, it is easy to switch to the evil branch at any time, because most of the upgrades in the good branch of the tech tree are also useful for specialists in the evil branch.
But the reverse is not true. If you spend XP in the evil branch, and later switch to the good branch, it is a waste of XP.
Each evil class, it needs to pretend to be in the good class. Ritualizers pretend to be academics. Credential-lords pretend to be artists. Utopists pretend to be philosophers.

## Past

Academics are people who learn an existing body of knowledge that is useful for cryptocurrency. For example, statisticians, game theorists, or computer scientists.
An academic builds up a wide set of tools from their discipline. These tools are used to explain complicated ideas in ways that anyone can understand.

It is the job of a ritualizer to perform a ritual to give legitimacy to a project that they want to promote. For example, writing long complicated proofs, or big expensive software. 

## Future

Philosophers are people who imagine alternative ways to organize ourselves in the future. They imagine how new technology will be used. Philosophers use tools from academics to build evidence for why their version of the future will come to pass.

Utopists are people who sell an impossible dream. They weave stories about how much better things will be in the future. They depend on ritualizers to give legitimacy to their fiction. 

## Present

Artists are people who choose one of the new philosophies, and they attempt to live it. Then they talk about their experience. It is moving the new philosophy from the theory stage to the experimental stage. Artists want you to understand their experiment, so you can repeat it for yourself, and build on top of that knowledge. 

Credential lords are the personalities of personality-cults. In some cultures it is known as a "white monkey job". A credential lord usually has many academic degrees, or a history of working for institutions with a lot of legitimacy. Credential lords want to be seen as incredibly intelligent, and able to understand things that almost no one else can understand. Credential lords want to convince you that this topic is too complicated to understand, that you need to believe in them, and you will get super rich. The credential lord is selling a product.

## PVP mode

in PVP mode, the evil classes have an advantage against the same good class.

Evidence from Academics is harder to understand than evidence from ritualizers. 

Philosophers are constrained by the limitations of reality. Utopists can promise anything. So the Utopist will always have the better dream to sell.

Artists have significantly less legitimacy than credential lords. So people are more likely to believe the claims of credential lords.

But, each evil type also has a weakness against one of the good types.

Academics can explain why the dreams of utopists are impossible.
Philosophers can ask credential-lords questions that reveal how little they understand.
Artists can live out the principles of ritualizers, to build up case studies for why this ritual does not work. 

Other combinations are either non-combatitive, or they fight with neither side having an advantage.
