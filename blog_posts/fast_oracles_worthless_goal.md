Why Making Oracles Faster is a Useless Goal
===============

There are zero benefits to a faster oracle resolution, and many problems.

Whether the oracle is faster or slower has no impact on user experience.

If people want to get their money out before full resolution, they can sell their shares for the same value that they would get in any other market with the same accuracy guarantees.

For example, lets say we are betting on an election, and the result of that election is finalized. In that case, everyone with losing shares would dump them to try to get any value out, and the price of losing shares would get very near to zero.
If losing shares go to zero, then the winning shares are necessarily worth nearly all the collateral in the contract.
This means that anyone can sell early to get their money out, they don't need to wait for the oracle to resolve.

Whoever the most patient person is, in the entire economy, will just be treating it as a 3 month CD or something â€” they will be thrilled if the price goes below .99,  .98  , etc


Imagine the election was a landslide for Biden, and that Trump conceded at 10 PM. Someone who bought Biden shares at .65 on Monday, would be able to sell them for .80   .85  .90  .95 cents as the landslide unfolded at 7-9 PM
At 10 PM it would tick up to .998
You could sell any number of shares at .998, that you had bought for .650
What is so urgent?
If you cared about time so much, sell them for .90 at 9 PM
Blast critical components of the system into pieces? So that someone can sell for 1 on Wednesday instead of .998
```
+53.846%  =       1/.65
+53.538%  = .998/.65
```
I mean, that assumes a risk free rate // time value of money of 1%
which is rather low isn't it?
But the FED currently has the 10 year treasury yield at 0.78 ....
