Fiat vs Cryptocurrency
==============

What kind of currency will be normal to use in the future?
Can cryptocurrency replace fiat?

Here someone tries to make the argument that fiat is a superior form of currency, and cryptocurrency will not replace it. https://www.interfluidity.com/uploads/2017/10/Fiat-Is-Effective-Minitalk-light-edit-to-share.pdf

This article by Waldman is using the logical fallacy of "Gish's Gallop", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop
Instead of making one solid well-reasoned point, they make tons of small half-baked arguments to overwhelm the the reader into accepting their conclusions.
I will look at Waldman's arguments, and show how each is unfounded.

1) fiat currencies are currently more effective.

* it is true that fiat is and has been more effective and popular, but that does not mean fiat will continue being more effective and popular in the future.

2) fiat currency is a more effective means of settlement, because if we have a contract to trade future money for some future good or service, contracts based on fiat can effectively balance the risk that buyer wont pay vs the risk that builder wont deliver.

* How contracts are enforced has no relationship to the currency that is used to denominate the contract. Whether I am paying for a good with US dollars or with beanie babies, contract enforcement doesn't need to change.

* A common thread in Waldman's paper is that he conflates the currency used to denominate contracts with the system used to enforce those contracts. These are independent systems that can be optimized individually.

* All methods of contract enforcement used with fiat are also compatible with cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency also enables new methods of contract enforcement, like smart contracts and oracles. Here is a math model to show how in some situations, these new forms of contract enforcement enabled by cryptocurrency can be more affordable than existing mechanisms https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs/blob/master/basics/trust_theory.md

3) Fiat currency is a more effective means of settlement, because of valuation risk. If the currency that denominates the contract varies too widely in price, it can harm the participants in that contract.

* There is no reason that contracts should be limited to being denominated in the value of any single currency. Contracts can be based on the value of a basket of goods optimized for the needs of the participants in that contract.

* Participants in a contract can also participate in other financial contracts to hedge their risks. So if each participant starts with different valuation risks, they can both still be completely hedged. 

4) fiat currency will win because it has a stable unit of account for assets.

* this is the same as (3).

5) fiat currency will win because it has a stable unit of account for liabilies.

* this is the same as (3).

6) fiat currency will win because it has stable unit of account according to historical consumper price index values.

* this is the same as (3).

7) getting paid in BTC means taking the risk that your wage suddenly falls in value relative to your liabilities.

* this is the same as (3).

8) fiat will win because it is stable-valued, because it is actively managed to be stable.

* this is the same as (3).

9) fiat is better at managing counterparty risk because payments are reversible.

* crypto payments can use arbiters to verify if the goods were delivered. This arbiter could even be exactly the same bankers who act as arbiters for fiat contracts.

* this is the same as (2).

10) escrow is expensive. It ties up money that could otherwise be used productively.

* Whether a payment is locked in cryptocurrency escrow until a banker approves it, or you are waiting for a fiat payment to arrive in your bank account, these are identical situations. Waldman is once again conflating the currency that denominates contracts with the system of enforcement. The same banker who would approve your payment in a fiat system could also be your escrow agent in a cryptocurrency system.

* this is the same as (2).

11) fiat currency makes it easier to lower the wages of your workers.

* It isn't clear why being able to lower the wage of workers would help a currency to succeed.

* Wages don't need to be denominated in any currency. It is possible to define a wage by the value of a basket of goods. 

12) fiat currency will win because it is possible to use fiat to invest in profitable contracts like short-term treasury bills.

* the currency used to denominate a contract does not matter. The same profitable contract can be denominated in a basket of goods, or in cheese wheels, or anything at all. As long as it is more profitable or less risky for people to hold your contract in comparison to not holding it, then they will hold it.

13) fiat systems rule the world

* this is the same as (1)

14) you measure your wealth in fiat.

* same as (1).

15) fiat currencies can maintain their value better because the governments that manage them can collect taxes in that currency, which creates constant demand for the currency.

* same as (3).
