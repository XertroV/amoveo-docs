Why there will not be voting in a post-futarchy world
================

In a post-futarchy world, we will organize ourselves around institutions with concrete goals.
Members in an institution will cooperate on a decision if futarchy demonstrates that the decision helps to advance the goals of their institution.
If you disagree with the goals of an institution, you would vote with your feet by not wasting any time or energy participating in that institution.

Imagine there was an institution with the goal:
"we should do what the majority wants, at any expense to the minority".
This goal is not self-consistent.
You can redraw lines to make anyone part of the minority.
So a majority-rules institution would eternally waste it's energy on violently redistributing the resources of it's members.
Re-dividing a smaller and smaller pie between it's members.
A majority-rules institution would cannibalize itself, and so would not have any influence in post-futarchy society.
