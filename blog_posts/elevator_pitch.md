Elevator Pitch
===========

Derivatives are powerful financial tools.

Derivatives are used to insure against risk.
For example, if your local currency is unstable, you can use a derivative to protect youself from the possibility that your currency will lose value.

Derivatives are used to communicate your future needs.
For example, if you have a restaurant that sells a certain amount of beef every month, then you can use derivatives to communicate your beef needs ahead of time.
This allows you to buy at a better price, and it helps the cow farmer to plan. 

Today, the majority of people are locked out of these powerful tools.

Blockchain is the technology that powers bitcoin. With blockchain, you don't need anyone's permission, and no one can be excluded. We are putting derivatives inside of a blockchain, that way everyone will have access.

Additionally, blockchains cut out a lot of middle-men in finance. Which should allow for lower fees, and faster service.
