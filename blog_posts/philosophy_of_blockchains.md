Blockchain Philosophy
=========

There are many perspectives on what currencies are, why they exist, and what it would mean for one currency to be better than another.

This post is meant to explore the motivations and beliefs of several major communities that make up the participants in cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. 


Monitary Policy with an Immutable Plan - IMP
========

This community is a reaction to centrally controlled interest rates and central banking.
They feel that it is hard to do business effectively because they cannot predict how the central planners will adjust the interest rate, inflation, and other aspects of monetary policy.
This community feels that the best currency would be one that has a very clear plan, so we can do business and have clear expectations for how the money will work.

Critique - IMP is overly focused on problems with the existing system, and they aren't taking time to compare different cryptocurrencies against one another. Simply being better than the existing system isn't enough to win, you also have to be better than the other alternatives.


Byzantine Fault Tolerant - BFT
=========

Currency is a computer program. There is a database accounts and balances. There are rules for when they can be changed.
The various servers need to agree on the current state of all the account balances.
Keeping databases in sync is a problem that computer scientists solved long ago.
We can re-use any of the byzantine fault tolerant database solutions.

Critique - BFT is self-limiting to the language of computer science. The systems they build do have massive volume of throughput, but the gains are illusory. Since they don't take the time to consider motivations or game theory, they end up building systems that can be profitably attacked.


Smart Contracts - SC
===========

This community feels that a currency is more useful if it can be used for more purposes.
They feel that whatever currency enables the most variety of usecases is best.
This philosophy emphasizes that blockchain is new technology, and we cannot yet know what it will be used for. So we should cast a wide net and see what we find.

Critique - Being able to do everything means you can't be the best at anything. Blockchains are new, but finance is not. We know a lot about what kind of financial services people want, and delivering on those use-cases is more helpful than trying to solve problems that don't exist.


Mathematical Rationality - MR
==========

The success of a currency is the total value invested in the financial services that it provides, something that can be calculated.

This community feels that currency is a platform for financial services, and that the cost of using these financial service is a determining factor in whether the currency will gain customers and succeed.
They feel that the equilibrium cost of using a financial service can be calculated by applying tools from game theory to the design of the currency.

This philosophy is based on the idea that each individual would prefer having more value instead of less value.
Evolutionarily speaking, if some participants in a game only focus on gaining value, and other participants optimize for anything other than gaining value, eventually the majority of value will be controlled by those participants who had only focused on gaining value.
So the assumption that each individual would prefer having more value, this assumption is correct on an evolutionary time-scale.

Critique - narrowly focusing on the financial incentives of each strategy ignores the rich complexity involved in human decision making. People are influenced by a sense of right vs wrong, loyalty to their team, and many other things which can't be accurately modeled in terms of financial cost.
If there is some way to use brand-loyalty or a sense of morality to build a more affordable product, this philosophy would fail to find it.
