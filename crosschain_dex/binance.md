Binance DEX
===========


It is very difficult to get any information on the binance DEX. This is my understanding of their product based on the limited information that they have made available.

You send your BTC/ETH or whatever to binance, and they give you a trusted wrapped version managed by the centralized binance team instead.
Security wise, this is no different from depositing your BTC/ETH onto the centralized binance exchange.

You can trade your wrapped tokens on their on-chain order book.
Then you swap your wrapped tokens back for the BTC/Eth whatever with the centralized binance team, and hope that they give you back your BTC.
Security wise, this is the same thing as withdrawing BTC from the centralized binance exchange.

Similar to like Tether, Binance claims to be holding all the cryptocurrency backing each of their wrapped tokens as collateral to maintain the value of their wrapped token.

There is no point to creating a blockchain for this, because the security is the same as just depositing your money into the centralized Binance exchange. 

Calling this a "DEX" is very misleading. I think you should not do business with a company that misleads it's customers this way. Imagine what else they could be lying about.
