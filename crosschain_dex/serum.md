Serum crosschain swap review
==============

The serum home page is not accessible, but I was able to find a [reddit discussion about how it works](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/igqk5l/6_reasons_why_serum_wont_succeed/)

Serum's cross chain swap is similar to Amoveo's, except instead of offloading the computation to a trustless oracle like Amoveo, Serum is trying to use an Ethereum smart contract to verify that the tx had occured on another blockchain.

Producing the proof that the tx had occured on another blockchain is very difficult, and it is a different process for every blockchain.

Verifying this proof on the Ethereum blockchain is prohibitively expensive.
