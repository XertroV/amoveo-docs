Thorchain
============

[Looking at the thorchain docs](https://docs.thorchain.org/) in the section "introduction".

Thorchain is secured by "node operators", they are teams of specialized reporters who have locked value into a bond, and they vote on whether transactions have occured or not.

These "node operators" are analogous to "staked vault nodes" in chainflip. So the problems that apply to chainflip also apply to thorchain. [You can read the chainflip review here](chainflip.md)
